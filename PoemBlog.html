<h2 style="color:DogerBlue"> Be A Woman! </h2>
  <p1>Hey Woman,
know the woman within
    and start  blossoming.</p1>

<p2>Fly high and high
  till you think you are a butterfly.</p2>

<p3>I know there will be days of hardship
  but there will be a day you feel some strong grip.</p3>

<p4>Don't measure yourself too low
  one day your achievements will glow.</p4>

<p5>Maybe today is not the day
  but there will be a way.</p5>

<p6>Don't be afraid of the dark circle
do something extraordinary in your life cycle.</p6>
