<h2 style="text-align:center;", "color:DogerBlue;"> Be A Woman! </h2>
  <p>Hey Woman,
know the woman within
    and start  blossoming.<br></p>

<p>Fly high and high
  till you think you are a butterfly.<br></p>

<p>I know there will be days of hardship
  but there will be a day you feel some strong grip.<br></p>

<p>Don't measure yourself too low
  one day your achievements will glow.<br></p>

<p>Maybe today is not the day
  but there will be a way.<br></p>

<p>Don't be afraid of the dark circle
do something extraordinary in your life cycle.<br></p>
