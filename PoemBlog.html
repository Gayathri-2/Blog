<p2>Hey Woman,
know the woman within
and start  blossoming.

Fly high and high
till you think you are a butterfly.

I know there will be days of hardship
but there will be a day you feel some strong grip.

Don't measure yourself too low
one day your achievements will glow.

Maybe today is not the day
but there will be a way.

Don't be afraid of the dark circle
do something extraordinary in your life cycle.</p2>
